# chapter 9

This chapter implements binary search(which I described briefly in the chapter7/8 summary).

This got me wondering, how do complex where and like filters work internally?? And how do joins between tables work internally??

Updating and deleting from a node is possible from what I know(updating leaf node key-values and deleting leaf nodes + rebalancing the tree)

Okay coming back from this after a long break and I just really hate C. I think I'm going to leave this here and do Rust and/or Go. I don't have enough mental power after work to deal with C and all of it's weirdness.
