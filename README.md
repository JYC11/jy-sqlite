# jy-sqlite

building a sqlite clone in C by following a tutorial to learn about how databases work(and learning C at the same time)

The said tutorial: https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/

I would like to write tests but that makes the scope of this mini-project too big. C is already difficult enough. Maybe later(read: Never)?

### Note to self:

command to compile: gcc db.c -o db
